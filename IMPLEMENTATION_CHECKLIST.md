## Testing Checklist

### Authentication Flow
- [ ] Verify unauthenticated users are redirected to signin

### Host Management
- [ ] Verify host information is stored in meeting data
- [ ] Test host can leave and rejoin while maintaining status
- [ ] Verify `isHost` flag is correct in responses

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL=                    # Your app URL
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=                 # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
AUTH0_SECRET=                    # Auth0 secret

# Auth0
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=     # From Auth0 dashboard
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=             # From Auth0 dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN=        # your-domain.auth0.com
AUTH0_ISSUER=                    # https://your-domain.auth0.com

# AWS
AWS_REGION=                      # e.g., us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=               # AWS credentials

```

### Verification
- [ ] All environment variables are set
- [ ] Auth0 application configured correctly
- [ ] AWS Chime SDK permissions granted
- [ ] Callback URLs configured in Auth0
- [ ] CORS settings configured

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Check HTTPS is enabled
- [ ] Backup current production database (if applicable)

### Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment first
- [ ] Run smoke tests on staging
- [ ] Verify authentication works on staging
- [ ] Test meeting creation on staging
- [ ] Test meeting join on staging
- [ ] Monitor logs for errors
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Run post-deployment verification

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor error rates

## Quick Commands

### Test Authentication
```bash
# Run development server
npm run dev

# Test as authenticated user
# 1. Go to http://localhost:3000
# 2. Click "Create Meeting" - should redirect to signin
# 3. Sign in with Auth0
# 4. Click "Create Meeting" - should succeed
```

### Check Logs
```bash
# View server logs
npm run dev | grep "Unauthorized\|error\|Error"

# Check for authentication issues
npm run dev | grep "auth\|session"
```

### Verify Environment
```bash
# Check required env vars are set
env | grep -E "AUTH0|NEXTAUTH|AWS_"
```
